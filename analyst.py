    2. "hypothesis": A 2-3 sentence hypothesis explaining the most likely reason for the delta between the actual price and the forecast. You MUST cite specific data points (e.g., "negative sentiment", "overbought RSI > 70", etc.) to support your hypothesis.
    3. "influential_headlines": From the list provided, choose up to 3 headlines you believe were most influential on the sentiment and price action. This must be an array of JSON objects, where each object has a "title" and "url" key.
